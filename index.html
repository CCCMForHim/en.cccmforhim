      <h2 class="f2 blue">OUR MISSION</h2>
      <p>Chicago Chinese Christian Missions (CCCM) is a non-denominational, cross-cultural, mission mobilization organization. We are dedicated to unifying churches for the purpose of motivating and equipping Christ’s followers to commit to mission ministries. </p>
      <h2 class="f2 blue">OUR STRATEGY</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Sponsoring  conferences  to  mobilize  attendees towards missions.  </li>
        <li>Providing training courses to equip mission workers </li>
        <li>Facilitating short-term mission trips to provide opportunities and hands-on experiences in preparation for future long term mission participation.  </li>
      </ol>
      <h2 class="f2 blue">OUR HISTORY</h2>
      <p>The influx of new Chinese immigrants and students coming to America in the 90’s presented the Chinese Christians in US a golden opportunity to share the gospel with our kindred who had a very limited opportunity to hear the gospel in their homeland. Many Bible study groups were formed on campuses across the country to meet the demands. In the spring of 1997, a gospel camp was organized in Cedar Lake, IN, leading to the later establishment of CCCM at Chicago in 2001.  </p>
      <p>CCCM, officially registered to the federal government in 2003, is a non-profit, tax exempt 501 (c)(3) organization with the purpose to serve Chinese churches in Chicago and the Midwest region. </p>
      <h2 class="f2 blue">OUR MINISTRIES</h2>
      <h3 class="f3 underline">1. TRAINING</h3>
      <h4 class="f4">“Kairos” Course</h4>
      <p>In co-sponsoring with like-minded organizations, this unique mission course emphasizes on the biblical, historical, strategic, and cultural dimensions of missions. With an aim to facilitate a life changing journey, it seeks to align every believer’s worldview with God’s heart for the nations and to mobilize the whole Church for global missions to the least reached people groups.</p>
      <h4 class="f4">Theological Education by Extension (TEE) Course</h4>
      <p>In co-sponsoring with TMCC (TEE Movers for Chinese Church), this practical theology course is an 18 month integrated program to lay a foundation for lay Christian workers and leaders. The core course, “The Life of Christ”, is based on the Gospel of Matthew (150 lessons in 6 books), which has become a valuable training tool to equip the local churches in mission fields. There were 69 students in Chicagoland who graduated in 2015.</p>
      <h3 class="f3 underline">2. CONFERENCES</h3>
      <h4 class="f4">Gospel Camp</h4>
      <p>The first Gospel Camp was held on Memorial Day weekend in 1997. For the last 18 years it has become an annual gospel event to many Chinese churches in the Midwest region. Numerous Christians received training in personal evangelism through participation in the camp; and, more than 700 unbelievers have been led to Christ through this ministry. This year the attendance grew to more than 420.  </p>
      <h4 class="f4">Campus Ministry Conference</h4>
      <p>Since 2011, CCCM has been co-sponsoring campus ministry conferences with like-minded organizations in North America to cultivate strategic thinking and facilitate networking among the Chinese speaking campus ministries for the purpose of arousing effective outreach to the fast-growing Chinese student population on campuses across America for Christ. This year’s conference will be held in November at Chicago, at Los Angeles, CA, and at Austin, TX, separately in different weekends. </p>
      <h3 class="f3">Chinese Global Leadership Summit</h3>
      <p>This yearly event is co-sponsored with Willow Creek Association, Barrington, Illinois with the purpose to inspire, encourage, and equip Christian leaders to build thriving local churches to win their communities for Christ. This year’s Summit was held on April 18th at Elk Grove Baptist Church, Elk Grove Village, Illinois. More than 120 church leaders attended. </p>
      <h4 class="f4">Chicago Chinese Christian Conference</h4>
      <p>Since 2005, Chicago Chinese Christian Conference (CCCC) has become a high light event in December for the Chinese Christians and churches around the Midwest. The purpose of this event is to challenge and mobilize Christians and churches for global missions. In 2014, the attendance reached a record high of over 1,500 among which, 48 committed their lives for fulltime mission work.</p>
      <h3 class="f3 underline">3. SHORT TERM MISSION</h3>
      <h4 class="f4">Midwest STM Team</h4>
      <p>Since 2009, CCCM has been organizing short-term mission trips from among the churches in Chicagoland to support various campus ministries across the Midwest region. This ministry has proved to be effective both in mobilizing the Chicagoland churches and in enhancing the campus ministries, and has been growing rapidly. This fall we had a total of 56 members divided into 4 STM teams, who, as a result, led 37 unbelievers to Christ. </p>
      <h4 class="f4">Overseas STM Team</h4>
      <p>This team’s primary mission is to provide training, teaching, and mentorship to the campus workers and student leaders of campus fellowships in a restricted area in Asia for the purpose of raising a new generation of mission force to further the missions to the unreached. We also provide financial support to the indigenous campus workers in that region. </p>
